# Quadratic Equation

Please write a code that calculates the roots of a quadratic equation with the form

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>a</em> <em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + <em>b</em> <em>x</em> + <em>c</em> = 0</p>

For the coefficients defined at the beginning of the program in the appropriate variables. For now, we assume that the coefficient *a* is not zero and we allow complex solutions (which means that the equation always has exactly two solutions and we do not need to verify it). Calculation result should be printed using the `print` function in the form of two numbers separated by a space.

In the file `exercise1.py` there is a program template with the definition of example equation parameters. It needs to be completed.
